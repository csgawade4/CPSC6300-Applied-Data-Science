# Acceleration Prediction fo Cars using R

Project's primary focus is to predict the acceleration performance of a vehicle using the predictors that are
available to the car manufacturer at the vehicle development or target definition stage. The Acceleration
performance is measured as the time required for vehicles to accelerate from zero (stand-still) to sixty mph in
seconds. This is one of the key features any car manufacturer advertises.
